#### Exercise 11: CSS Drawing
Create a drawing using only HTML and CSS of something Halloween themed or an object around your house. To do this you will make some divs, position them on the page, and then style each piece with CSS. The divs will then get layered and moved around to make your final drawing. Take a look at this [link](https://blog.prototypr.io/how-i-started-drawing-css-images-3fd878675c89) for a reference on how these might get set up.

##### Requirements
* A Halloween themed drawing or a drawing of something around your house
* All styles in external style sheet
* HTML uses divs and CSS uses positioning
