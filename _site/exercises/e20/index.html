        <h2 class="event"> Exercise 20 Programmer and Computer </h2>
        <h4 id="exercise-20-programmer-and-computer">Exercise 20: Programmer and Computer</h4>

<p>PART 1 - THE PROGRAMMER: Create a simple drawing in XD in 2 minutes. Once you are finished, write a very precise set of instructions that will be executed by a computer. A classmate will be the computer and the result of that person following your program should result in an exact copy of your drawing. You cannot use images or verbal communications to help explain your instructions, only written words. You also cannot let the computer see what the final drawing should look like.</p>

<p>Upload the instructions to your website but do not upload the drawing yet.</p>

<p>PART 2 - THE COMPUTER: Using a classmates program, execute those instructions to recreate the drawing. Do not assume instructions, follow what is written as closely as you can. Send the final drawing back to the programmer. Do this step for two different programs.</p>

<p>PART 3 - UPLOAD: Once you have two drawings back from the two different computers, upload the two drawings along with your original to the same page as the instructions.</p>

<p>BRIEF HISTORY LESSON: A computer was actually a job description held by many humans at one point in time, especially during WWII, where computers (mostly women) were hired to do calculation and computation on vast quantities of numbers. Also, Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815–November 17, 1852), the daughter of poet Lord Byron, published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine and is regarded as the first computer programmer. Furthermore, the term “debugging” originated from the actions of programmer Grace Hopper (December 9, 1906–January 1, 1992), who took a literal moth out of military computer. In today’s male-dominated tech fields, it’s important recognize the roots of computation and programming.</p>
