    <h4> Project 1: Linking Narratives </h4>
    <p class="description"> The structure of a website is as equally important as the design of a website. Getting from page X to page Y needs to be intuitive and simple. This structure also needs to be reflected on the back end. Create a site that takes the user through a narrative using text, links, and multiple pages. </p>

    <p class="description"> Understanding each step in the process of a website project is important no matter what role you take in that process. Understanding how a website is planned and conceptualized or how a website is build can help the design. Understanding the concepts and principles that went into the design can help how a site is built. This project puts you in each role of the process, from the initial idea to the final build. </p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

    <h4 id="exercise-1-20-questions">Exercise 1: 20 Questions</h4>

<p>Read through each discussion post from your classmates and create a web page that answers each question asked. That means you will answer 20 questions total — 19 of your classmates questions plus one of your own. The page will be simple and use default styles but should display the question and your answer in a clear way. If you need a little help starting, check out <a href="/tutorials/t1">tutorial 1</a>.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> element with relevant content</li>

    <h4 id="exercise-2-make-the-grid">Exercise 2: Make the Grid</h4>

<p>Using XD or other approved design software make 5 artboards that are 1440 pixels wide by 3000 pixels tall. On each artboard create a grid that could be used to layout a website. The grid does not need rows, only columns. Once you have 5 different grids start adding some “content” to your pages. The content should be shapes (squares, rectangles, circles) that could represent images, icons, text, etc. Some shapes should be tall, some shapes should be short, some should be wide, and some should be narrow. The grid should be your guide for how your shapes line up and fit on the page. Do not ignore the grid. Keep in mind ideas about space and that every pixel of the page does not need to be filled. If you need a little help starting, check out <a href="/tutorials/t2">tutorial 2</a>.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>

<ul>
  <li>5 png files at 1440px wide by 3000px tall</li>
  <li>Layouts use only shapes</li>
  <li>Layouts use different grids</li>

    <h4 id="e3-organization-and-naming">E3: Organization and Naming</h4>

<p>File naming and organization are important parts of making sure your files are easy to find both visually and while writing links. Download this zip file and you will find there is a simple site with a terrible file structure. Rename these files something clear and simple and then organize them into a nice folder structure. The site has a main page and then 3 sub pages for an about page, a menus page, and a gallery page.</p>

<p>Once you have organized and renamed the files, take a screenshot of the new structure and post it to your site (Atom’s sidebar is a great view). If you cannot get a view where all the files and folders are shown in one folder, take multiple screenshots or position multiple folders on the screen to show the structure.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Folders and files appropriately named</li>
  <li>Folders and files appropriately organized</li>
  <li>Screenshot(s) of folder and file structure and names on your site</li>

<p>Create a site map showing the structure and organization of a website. Also include who you think the intended audience is and what the main action or actions the site is hoping a user will accomplish. The site needs to be more than a few pages. It should multiple levels of information across multiple pages. You can create your site map in any software you choose but it needs to be done digitally. My recommendation would be to use Xd.</p>

<p>Upload a PNG of your final site map to your site and include a link to the website you made the site map for.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>URL for your website</li>

The second wireframe should be created from the site as it looks on your phone (mobile size). You can create both of them sketched on paper, both digitally, or one of each.</p>

    <h4 id="e6-type-on-screen-i">E6: Type on Screen I</h4>
<p>Select a book from this <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top">list</a>. Using the title, author, chapter title, and the first 1000 words, make 6 different layouts. Each layout should be unique in design but the content will be the same. Focus on contrast, hierarchy, and positioning and make considered decisions about the type you choose. The first three of the layouts will just be in black and white with no images and the second three you can use color and images if you want. Design some pages with one typeface and some pages with multiple typefaces. Try symmetrical and asymmetrical layouts and size, weight, style and other typographic concepts to create a well designed, readable page. All the layouts should use a grid to help with the layout.</p>

<p>Each layout should be on an artboard that is 1440px wide by however tall it needs to be to accommodate the content.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>A title, author, chapter title, and 1000 words on each layout</li>

The screenshots should be of the full height, meaning from top to bottom of the page, and taken with your browser at widths of 1440px, 1024px, 768px, and 320px (or the smallest your browser width will go). Arrange the screenshots taken at each width in XD (or your design software) on an artboard that is the appropriate width and height.

  <article class="single" id="e14">
    <h4 id="exercise-20-programmer-and-computer">Exercise 20: Programmer and Computer</h4>

<p>PART 1 - THE PROGRAMMER: Create a simple drawing in XD in 2 minutes. Once you are finished, write a very precise set of instructions that will be executed by a computer. A classmate will be the computer and the result of that person following your program should result in an exact copy of your drawing. You cannot use images or verbal communications to help explain your instructions, only written words. You also cannot let the computer see what the final drawing should look like.</p>

<p>Upload the instructions to your website but do not upload the drawing yet.</p>

<p>PART 2 - THE COMPUTER: Using a classmates program, execute those instructions to recreate the drawing. Do not assume instructions, follow what is written as closely as you can. Send the final drawing back to the programmer. Do this step for two different programs.</p>

<p>PART 3 - UPLOAD: Once you have two drawings back from the two different computers, upload the two drawings along with your original to the same page as the instructions.</p>

<p>BRIEF HISTORY LESSON: A computer was actually a job description held by many humans at one point in time, especially during WWII, where computers (mostly women) were hired to do calculation and computation on vast quantities of numbers. Also, Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815–November 17, 1852), the daughter of poet Lord Byron, published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine and is regarded as the first computer programmer. Furthermore, the term “debugging” originated from the actions of programmer Grace Hopper (December 9, 1906–January 1, 1992), who took a literal moth out of military computer. In today’s male-dominated tech fields, it’s important recognize the roots of computation and programming.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>

<ul>
  <li>The instructions to complete the drawing your website (the program)</li>
  <li>Your drawing along with the two drawings from your computers (3 total images)</li>
</ul>
